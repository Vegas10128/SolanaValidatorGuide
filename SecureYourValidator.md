## How to secure your Solana Validator
Security is an important responsibility of a Validator Owner.   We recommend that all validators take the basic steps to lock down their servers to prevent attacks on the network and to avoid loss of keys etc.

#### Update your software
#### Use a Firewall
#### Create a non root privileged account
#### Setup SSH key based authentication
#### Disable Password Authentication
#### Optional
###### Use Fail2Ban 
###### Disable unused unix services
###### Use 2FA for Authentication
